## slogan: Beautiful and High-performance 3D GIS

## Dream Something Big

I am trying to build a 3D frontend GIS framework based on three.js (maybe). Robust and easy to use. I hope I can do it. Some properties are:

    - Beautiful pre-set visualization style but with the ability to customize the style
    - High performance
    - Elegant API
    - Powered by AI (maybe)

While the meta-world is dropping out of the world, I am still diving into the world of 3D GIS technology. This domain should get away from drawbacks like poor performance and an ugly visualization style:

- performance: 3D GIS technology is still in its infancy, and it is still a big challenge to make it run smoothly on a browser. I think it is a good time to do something about it.
- visualization style: Morden frontend pages are getting more and more beautiful, and 3D GIS technology should be a match for it in styles and other performances.

## Think Something Deep

Meta-world is not only about 3D visualization but also about the essence of our everyday life and the world's deep structure. An ideal meta-world solution(platform?) should be able to provide a new way to think about the world, the big picture. It should stand based on pure math, not the surface(visualization). The traditional solution must meet its bottleneck when the data scale is going big. The bottleneck may chunk the whole system. The meta-world solution should be able to solve this problem.
